# üì± Product Description

## Overview

Our app is a **personalized gift discovery and reminder platform** that helps users find the perfect present for any occasion. By combining **user-provided recipient profiles** (interests, demographics, past gifts) with **Amazon‚Äôs product catalog**, the app delivers curated gift recommendations. Users can engage casually without an account, or unlock powerful features by creating one.

* **Amazon Integration**: Browse real products via Amazon‚Äôs API. Deep-link to Amazon with our referral tag for affiliate revenue.

## 2. Business Model

### 2.1 Revenue Source

* **Amazon Associates Program**: All sales flow through your affiliate tag.
* Commission is credited to your app‚Äôs account.

### 2.2 Creator Partnership Program

* **Mechanism**:

  * Creators receive a unique **referral code / link** (e.g., `?ref=creator123`).
  * When a user installs/opens the app with that referral, the app logs the creator ID.
  * All affiliate sales from that user are attributed to the creator.
* **Backend Handling**:

  * Firebase stores `creatorId` in the user profile (persistent across devices if logged in).
  * Commission data from Amazon is aggregated at your end.
  * Monthly payouts to creators handled by you (outside Amazon).

### 2.3 Incentives

* **For Creators**:

  * Earn a % share of commissions from all purchases made by referred users.
  * Transparent reporting dashboard (earnings, clicks, purchases).
* **For Users**:

  * Free use forever, no subscription.
* **For You**:

  * Single affiliate relationship with Amazon ‚Üí compliance & reporting simplified.
  * Build an ecosystem of creators pushing traffic into your app.

* **Payout Disputes**: Provide transparent reporting (based on Amazon‚Äôs official sales reports).

* **Phase 3**: Creator dashboard + payout system.
